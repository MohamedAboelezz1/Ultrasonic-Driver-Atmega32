# Ultrasonic-Driver-Atmega32
Implement a driver ultrasonic using peripheral DIO and ICU 
Implement the following system to measure the distance using ultrasonic sensor
HC-SR04 with the specifications listed below:
1. Use ATmega32 Microcontroller with frequency 8Mhz.
2. Measure the distance using the Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04.
3. The LCD should display the distance value.
4. The project should be designed and implemented based on the layered architecture
model.
